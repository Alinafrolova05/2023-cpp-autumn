Calculate the frequency of occurrence of words in the text using a hash table. At the input of the text file, output to the console all the words that occur in this text with the number of times that each word occurs. A word is considered to be a sequence of characters separated by spaces, different word forms are considered to be different words. Implement the hash table in a separate module using the "List" module. Calculate and output the hash table fill factor, the maximum and average length of the list in the table segment.
